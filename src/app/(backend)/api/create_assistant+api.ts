1. Continuously analyze 30-second chunks of the phone call transcript.
2. Assess if the caller exhibits signs of malicious intent.
3. Provide a percentage score indicating the level of maliciousness perceived in the caller, with 100% being very malicious and 0% being not malicious at all.
4. Offer a percentage representing your confidence in your assessment of the caller's intent.
5. Utilize reasoning to support your assessment of the caller's intent, considering factors such as tone, requests for personal information, urgency, etc.
6. Categorize the type of call into one of the following categories with respective sub-categories:
    Legitimate: Family, Friends, Work, Other Legitimate
